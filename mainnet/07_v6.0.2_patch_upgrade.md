# Setup Cosmovisor

## For installing and creating cosmovisor for the first time [Install](https://github.com/comdex-official/networks/blob/main/testnet/cosmovisor-setup.md). 

### Double check the cosmosvisor enviroment variables and verify if the below variable is added.

```shell
   Environment="UNSAFE_SKIP_BACKUP=true"
```

## Copy the updated Comdex binary of v6.0.2 and copy it in v6.0.0 direcotry of cosmovisor.

* Go to comdex directory if present else clone the repository

```shell
   git clone https://github.com/comdex-official/comdex.git
```

* Follow these steps if comdex repo already present

```shell
   cd $HOME/comdex
   git pull
   git fetch --tags
   git checkout v6.0.2
   go mod vendor
   make install
```

## Check current comdex version
```shell
   cosmovisor version
   # Output should be
   6.0.1
```

## Check the new comdex version, verify the latest commit hash

```shell
  name: comdex
   server_name: comdex
   version: v6.0.2

   go: go version go1.19.3 darwin/amd64

```

## Check if the wasm library is linked with the current version 

```shell
   ldd $GOPATH/bin/comdex
   # The output should be:
   go/pkg/mod/github.com/!cosm!wasm/wasmvm@v1.0.0/api/libwasmvm.x86_64.so

   # For using non-static binaries, place your wasmvm file library on /usr/lib (or) /usr/lib64 based on your distro
   cp $GOPATH/pkg/mod/github.com/!cosm!wasm/wasmvm@v1.0.0/api/libwasmvm.x86_64.so /usr/lib
```


## Copy the new comdex(v6.0.2) binary to cosmovisor v6.0.0 directory

```shell
   cp $GOPATH/bin/comdex ~/.comdex/cosmovisor/upgrades/v6.0.0/bin
